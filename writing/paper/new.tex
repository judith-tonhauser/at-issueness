\begin{abstract}
  at-issueness is a key concept in theoretical semantics/pragmatics, but there is no consensus about how it is defined or diagnosed (e.g., \citealt{tonhauser_diagnosing_2012,tonhauser_how_2018,koev_notions_2018}). We present experimental data investigating whether four widely used diagnostics for at-issueness yield consistent results. Our findings reveal significant differences across diagnostics, indicating they are not interchangeable. Since the diagnostics target distinct theoretical conceptions of at-issueness, these differences offer insight into their comparability.

\section{Introduction \label{sec:1_introduction}}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=12pt]

\item At-issueness is a key concept in experimental and theoretical semantics and pragmatics, relied on in the analysis of a broad range of phenomena (give examples). 

\item But what is at-issueness? There are multiple definitions and multiple diagnostics that make different assumptions about how at-issue content differs from not-at-issue content (give details on definitions and diagnostics, these could be the diagnostics we will eventually use).

\item So, we're currently in a state where there is no agreed on definition of at-issueness and multiple diagnostics. This raises the question of whether the currently available definitions define the same underlying concept and whether the diagnostics yield the same result. These are pressing questions for research on at-issueness (see, e.g., Tonhauser et al 2018, Koev 2018, who else?)

\item Some research has suggested that the answers to both of these questions is ``no'':

\begin{itemize}

\item On the theory-side, Snider: suggests that q-at-issueness and p-at-issueness differ (Korotkova?)

\item On the diagnostics-side, NRRCs: some research assumes that the content of medial and final ones is not-at-issue but Syrett/Koev results suggest that medial ones are more not-at-issue than final ones

\item On the diagnostics-side, Tonhauser et al 2018: comparison of asking-whether and are you sure diagnostic suggests some differences (p.526ff)

\item On the diagnostics-side, Tonhauser et al 2018 asking whether didn't find difference in exp 1a between know and discover (see also Solstad/Bott) but Xue/Onea found difference between wissen and entdecken

\item On the diagnostics-side, Degen/Tonhauser 2025 found fine-grained differences between CCs of clause-embedding predicates using the asking-whether diagnostic, where Hooper 1975 distinguished weak assertive (e.g., think, acknowledge), strong assertive (e.g., say, suggest), semi-factive (assertive; e.g., see, discover, know) and factive (nonassertive; e.g., be annoyed).


\end{itemize}

\item To date, there has not been a systematic comparison of diagnostics to understand whether different diagnostics yield the same results.

\item This paper takes a first step towards addressing the important questions pointed out above. Specifically, we compare the results of diagnostics to identify whether diagnostics yield the same results. As these diagnostics also differ in their underlying assumptions about at-issueness, the results of our experiments also bear on the question of whether currently available definitions define the same underlying concept.

\item The way we do this is by investigating the at-issueness of the same contents with several different diagnostics. 

\begin{itemize}

\item Exps 1-4:  

\begin{itemize}

\item Contents: Sentence-medial and -final NRRCs because one diagnostic found a difference, CCs of clause-embedding predicates because another diagnostic found fine-grained differences

\item Are these differences between contents replicated by the use of other diagnostics?

\end{itemize}

\item Exps 5-6:

\begin{itemize}

\item Contents: CCs of clause-embedding predicates because one diagnostic found fine-grained differences

\item Are these differences between contents replicated by the use of other diagnostics?

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\item A note on terminology before we get started:

\begin{itemize}

\item The theoretical concept of at-issueness may be a categorical notion or a gradient one (see, e.g., Tonhauser et al 2018, Ebert/xx 2024), we remain agnostic here.

\begin{itemize}

\item Categorical: e.g., content is at-issue iff it addresses the QUD, not-at-issue otherwise; gradient mean ratings could be attributed to uncertainty about what the QUD is

\item Gradient: e.g., the extent to which content is at-issue is the extent to which it is relevant to the QUD; gradient mean ratings may be taken to reflect gradient relevance.

\end{itemize}

\item We will continue talking about the diagnostics as diagnostics for at-issueness, even if they may ultimately turn out to not be diagnosing the same underlying concept.

\item For each diagnostic, we will collect ratings: e.g., under the `asking-whether' diagnostic we collect asking-whether ratings, under the QUD diagnostic we collect naturalness ratings. We compare the mean ratings of the contents under each diagnostic; given that we are aggregating over multiple items and participants (and ratings on a scale for some), we may say that the mean rating for one content is higher/lower than that of another, or that they do not differ. 

\item We will take these results to suggest that, given a particular diagnostic, one content is more/less at-issue than another or that the two contents don't differ in at-issueness. We will do this even though the diagnostics may ultimately diagnose different concepts. Also, this does not commit us to a categorical or gradient theoretical notion of at-issueness (see above).

\end{itemize}
