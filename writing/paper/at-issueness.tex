\begin{abstract}
  at-issueness is a key concept in theoretical semantics/pragmatics, but there is no consensus about how it is defined or diagnosed (e.g., \citealt{tonhauser_diagnosing_2012,snider_anaphoric_2017,snider_distinguishing_2018,tonhauser_how_2018,koev_notions_2018,faller_discourse_2019,korotkova_evidential_2020}). We present experimental data investigating whether four widely used diagnostics for at-issueness yield consistent results. Our findings reveal significant differences across diagnostics, indicating they are not interchangeable. Since the diagnostics target distinct theoretical conceptions of at-issueness, these differences offer insight into their comparability.

\section{Introduction \label{sec:1_introduction}}
  
  At-issueness is a key concept in theoretical semantics and pragmatics, used in the analysis of a wide range of phenomena, including presupposition, conventional implicature, evidentials, and expressives (e.g., \citealt{karttunen_conventional_1979,horton_presuppositions_1988,abbott_presuppositions_2000,faller_semantics_2003,potts_logic_2005,tonhauser_diagnosing_2012}). Although at-issuness is widely understood as distinguishing propositions expressing the main point of an utterance (at-issue content) from those conveying background information (not-at-issue content), there is no consensus on how to define this distinction. Multiple competing definitions and diagnostics exist, each grounded in different assumptions about the nature of the distinction.

  Four commonly used diagnostics are illustrated in (\pref{qud}--\pref{yesbut}) for sentence-medial appositive non-restrictive relative clauses (NRRCs), which are typically taken to contribute not-at-issue content (\citealt{potts_logic_2005}). Accordingly, participants are expected to: give low question-answer-match ratings under the QUD diagnostic \ref{qud}; not interpret the speaker to be asking about the NRRC content under the `asking-whether' diagnostic \ref{aw}; give low naturalness ratings under the direct-dissent diagnostic \ref{dd}; and prefer a \emph{yes}-response under the `yes, but' diagnostic in \ref{yesbut}.

  \ex. \label{qud}%
    QUD diagnostic (e.g., \citealt{tonhauser_diagnosing_2012,chen_presuppositions_2024})
    \a.[A:] \emph{What did Greg buy?}
    \b.[B:] \emph{Greg, who bought a new car, is envied by his neighbor.}
    \z.
    Question to participants: How well does B's response fit A's question?
  \z.

  \ex. \label{aw}%
    `asking whether' diagnostic (e.g., \citealt{tonhauser_how_2018,solstad_cataphoric_2024})\smallskip\\
      \emph{Is Greg, who bought a new car, envied by his neighbor?}\smallskip
  \\ Question to participants: Is the speaker asking whether Greg bought a new car?
  \z.

  \ex. \label{dd} Direct-dissent diagnostic (e.g., \citealt{tonhauser_diagnosing_2012,syrett_experimental_2015})
    \a.[A:] \emph{Greg, who bought a new car, is envied by his neighbor.}
    \b.[B:]\emph{No, that's not true, he didn't buy a new car.}
    \z.
  Question to participants: How natural is B's rejection of A's utterance?
  \z.

  \ex. \label{yesbut}%
    `yes, but' diagnostic (e.g., \citealt{xue_correlation_2011,destruel_cross-linguistic_2015})
    \a.[A:] \emph{Greg, who bought a new car, is envied by his neighbor.}
    \b.[B:] \emph{Yes, but he didn't buy a new car.} /
    \b.[] \emph{Yes, and he didn't buy a new car.} /
    \b.[] \emph{No, he didn't buy a new car.}
    \z.
    Task for participants: Choose the response that sounds best.
  \z.

  The QUD diagnostic \ref{qud} and the `asking whether' diagnostic \ref{aw} assume that discourse is structured around addressing a Question Under Discussion (QUD) (\citealt{roberts_information_1996,ginzburg_interrogatives_1996}), and that the at-issue content of an utterance interacts with the QUD (\citealt{amaral_review_2007,simons_what_2010}). Specifically, the QUD diagnostic (\citealt{tonhauser_diagnosing_2012,chen_presuppositions_2024}) assumes that only at-issue content can address a QUD established in prior discourse, while the `asking whether' diagnostic (\citealt{tonhauser_how_2018,solstad_cataphoric_2024}) assumes that the at-issue content of a question explicitly raises a QUD, whereas its not-at-issue content does not contribute to determining that QUD.

  Previous research has emphazised that these question-based diagnostics are based on different assumptions than the assent/dissent-based diagnostics (\pref{dd}+\pref{yesbut}), which are usually not interpreted within a QUD-framework (\citealt{snider_at-issueness_2017,snider_anaphoric_2017,snider_distinguishing_2018,koev_notions_2018,faller_discourse_2019,korotkova_evidential_2020}).

  For the direct-dissent diagnostic \ref{dd} and the `yes but' diagnostic \ref{yesbut}, it has been argued that they may not reflect at-issueness at all, but rather target the anaphoric availability of propositional content for response particles like English \emph{yes/no} (\citealt{snider_anaphoric_2017,snider_anaphoric_2017,snider_distinguishing_2018}). On another view, these diagnostics target a distinct notion of at-issueness (see \citealt{koev_notions_2018} and discussion in \citealt{faller_discourse_2019,korotkova_evidential_2020}), under which the at-issue content of an assertion constitues a proposal to update the common ground (based on \citealt{farkas_reacting_2010}). Accordingly such content can be directly affirmed or denied using default discourse moves that include response particles. Conversely, not-at-issue content is either presupposed (already entailed in the common ground; \citealt{stalnaker_presuppositions_1973,stalnaker_common_2002}), or newly imposed on the common ground (\citealt{murray_varieties_2014,anderbois_at-issue_2015}), and requires special discourse moves for rejection (\citealt{potts_logic_2005}).

  Consequently, there is currently no agreed-upon definition of at-issueness, and existing diagnostics may not be probing the same underlying phenomenon. This raises two critical questions:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Do the various diagnostics yield the same results?
    \item Do the existing definitions of at-issueness describe the same underlying phenomenon?
  \end{enumerate}

  \noindent Initial research on these questions has yielded mixed answers.

  While adnominal appositives are often reported to contribute not-at-issue content (\citealt{potts_logic_2005,amaral_review_2007,tonhauser_diagnosing_2012,destruel_cross-linguistic_2015,tonhauser_how_2018,solstad_cataphoric_2024}), a forced-choice continuation task in \citet{syrett_experimental_2015} suggested that clause-final appositive NRRCs are more at-issue than medial ones under a version of the direct-dissent diagnostic (see also \citealt{anderbois_crossing_2010}). This finding has been interpreted as evidence that final apposive NRRCs are more at-issue than medial ones at the point in discourse when participants select a response (\citealt{syrett_experimental_2015,jasinskaja_not_2016}). \citealt{koev_notions_2018} further argued that the direct-dissent diagnostic is sensitive to this medial/final distinction, while other tests are not.

  Beyond appositives, \citealt{tonhauser_how_2018} compared at-issueness measures for a range of 19 English expressions (including clause-medial appositives and the clause-embedding predicates \emph{know, discover} and \emph{annoyed}, among other expressions), using two diagnostics: the question-based `asking whether' diagnostic and the `Are you sure?' diagnostic (p.526ff). They found that contents generally received lower at-issueness ratings with the `asking whether' diagnostic, while the `Are you sure?' diagnostic showed greater variability both within and across expressions. Despite these differences, ratings from both diagnostics correlated with measures of projection inferences, suggesting that they may nonetheless be sensitive to a shared underlying phenomenon.

  To date, however, there has been no systematic experimental comparison of diagnostics to investigate whether they yield consistent results. This paper takes a first step toward addressing the above questions (i+ii) in a systematic way. Specifically, we assess whether the four widely used diagnostics in (\pref{qud}--\pref{yesbut}) give rise to the same pattern of results when applied to the same target contents. Our findings reveal significant differences across diagnostics, indicating they are not interchangeable. Because each diagnostic is grounded in distinct theoretical assumptions about what it means for content to be at-issue, this comparison also bears on whether currently available conceptions of at-issueness converge on a common underlying notion.

  We present the results from a series of experiments that systematically vary the diagnostic used to assess the at-issueness status of the same types of contents across experiments in English. Experiments 1--4 tests propositional contents associated with seven types of expressions: sentence-medial and sentence-final NRRCs and the complements of selected clause-embedding predicates (\emph{be right, confirm, confess, discover,} and \emph{know}). These contents were selected because previous research has found variability in their behavior on at-issueness diagnostics, such as Syrett and Koev's finding that medial and final NRRCs yield different results on the direct dissent diagnostic. Further, \citealt{degen-tonhauser-glossa} found fine-grained differences between the embedded content of 20 English clause-embedding predicates using the asking-whether diagnostic. \Cref{fig:dtglossa} shows the distribution of `asking whether' ratings by predicate in their study.

  In this paper, we operationalize each diagnostic through its established empirical task: question-answer match ratings for the QUD diagnostic, speaker intention judgments for the asking-whether diagnostic, naturalness ratings for direct dissent, and forced-choice responses for the ‘yes, but’ diagnostic.

  For each of the contents, we collect ratings across multiple items and participants, and compare the mean responses. Given that we are aggregating over multiple items and participants
  % (and ratings on a scale for some),
  we may say that the mean rating for one content is higher/lower than that of another, or that they do not differ. Following prior work (e.g., \citealt{tonhauser_how_2018}), we interpret higher mean/lower ratings as indicating that content is more/less at-issue under a given diagnostic, with two caveats:

  First, we remain agnostic about whether at-issueness is an underlyingly binary or a gradient property (cf. \citealt{tonhauser_how_2018,barnes_information_2023}). If at-issueness is gradient, the extent to which content is at-issue of a content may be understood as the extent to which it is relevant to the QUD or the main assertion, in which case gradient mean ratings may be taken to reflect gradient relevance. If at-issueness is categorical, content is at-issue iff it addresses the QUD or assertive proposal, and not-at-issue otherwise; and gradient mean ratings could be attributed to uncertainty about what the QUD is. For example, our interpretation of a content in a given utterance being more/less at-issue may be interpreted as reflecting the frequency or ease with which a particular QUD is attributed to that utterance.

  Second, we use the term “at-issueness diagnostic” descriptively throughout the paper, even though our findings may ultimately suggest that these diagnostics track distinct theoretical constructs. We return to this issue in the general discussion.

\section{Experiments 1-4 \label{sec:2_experiments}}

  % 
    To compare the results of at-issueness diagnostics, we conducted four experiments that each measured at-issueness with a different diagnostic, namely the QUD diagnostic (Exp.~1), the `asking whether' diagnostic (Exp.~2), the direct-dissent diagnostic (Exp.~3) and the `yes, but' diagnostic (Exp.~4).\footnote{The experiments, data and R code for generating the figures and analyses of the experiments reported in this paper are available at INSERT URL TO ANONYMOUS GITHUB REPO BEFORE SUBMISSION. All experiments were conducted with approval from the ethics review committee of [university name redacted for review]. \label{f:github}}
    %    
    Each experiment tested the same manipulation, comparing the propositional contents of the seven types of expressions (contents) illustrated in \ref{stims}: the contents of sentence-medial and sentence-final NRRCs \ref{stims.a}-\ref{stims.b}, as well as the contents of the clausal complements of \emph{know, discover, confess, confirm} and \emph{be right} \ref{stims.c}-\ref{stims.g}. Each content was randomly paired with one items from a item set shared across all four experiments.

    \ex.\label{stims}
    \a.\label{stims.a} Content of sentence-medial NRRC \\
      \emph{Lucy, who broke the plate, apologised.} $\leadsto$ Lucy broke the plate
    \b.\label{stims.b} Content of sentence-final NRRC \\
    \emph{The police found Jack, who saw the murder.} $\leadsto$ Jack saw the murder
    \b.\label{stims.c} Content of the clausal complement of \emph{know} \\
    \emph{Ann knows that Raul cheated on his wife.} $\leadsto$ Raul cheated on his wife
    \b.\label{stims.d} Content of the clausal complement of \emph{discover} \\
    \emph{Mary discovered that Denny ate the last cupcake.} $\leadsto$ Denny ate the last cupcake
    \b.\label{stims.e} Content of the clausal complement of \emph{be right} \\
    \emph{Tom is right that Ann stole the money.} $\leadsto$ Ann stole the money
    \b.\label{stims.f} Content of the clausal complement of \emph{confirm} \\
    \emph{Harry confirmed that Greg bought a new car.} $\leadsto$ Greg bought a new car
    \b.\label{stims.g} Content of the clausal complement of \emph{confess}  \\
    \emph{Lucy confessed that Dustin lost his key.} $\leadsto$ Dustin lost his keys
    \z.
    \z.

    These seven contents were chosen because prior literature observed differences in at-issueness between two or more of these contents using a particular diagnostic for at-issueness.  Specifically, as discussed in \S1, \citealt{syrett_experimental_2015} observed differences between sentence-medial and -final NRRCs using a variant of the direct-dissent diagnostic,
    % \citealt{tonhauser_how_2018} observed differences between sentence-medial NRRCs and the contents of the complements of \emph{know, discover} and \emph{be annoyed} using the `asking whether' diagnostic,
    and \citealt{degen-tonhauser-glossa} observed differences between \emph{know, discover, confess, confirm} and \emph{be right} using the `asking whether' diagnostic. Thus, comparing these seven contents across the four diagnostics in Exps.~1-4 will allow us to assess whether the differences that emerge from one diagnostic also emerge from others. In each experiment, participants read the stimuli and gave ratings corresponding to the diagnostics.

  \subsection{Methods}
    
    \subsubsection{Participants}

      For each of the four experiments, we recruited 80 unique participants on Prolific. These participants had registered on the platform as living in the USA and as having English as their primary language. They had at least 50 previous submissions and an approval rate of at least 97\%.  Table \ref{t:recruited} shows the age and gender distributions of the recruited participants.

      \end{table}

    \subsubsection{Materials and procedure}
      
      The four experiments measured the at-issueness of the seven contents in \ref{stims}, each using a different diagnostic: the QUD diagnostic (Exp.~1), the `asking whether' diagnostic (Exp.~2), the direct-dissent diagnostic (Exp.~3), and the `yes, but' diagnostic (Exp.~4). The examples in \ref{diag} illustrate how each diagnostic was implemented using sentence-medial NRRCs (with the item `Lucy broke the plate').

      In Exp.~1 (QUD diagnostic, \ref{diag.a}), participants read a dialogue between two named speakers, where the first utters a constituent question (the presumed QUD) that is about the target content and the second responds with a declarative sentence that contributes the target content. In Exp.~2 (`asking whether' diagnostic, \ref{diag.b}), participants read a polar question uttered by a named speaker, which itself contributes the target content.
      %
      In Exp.~3 (direct-dissent diagnostic, \ref{diag.c}), participants read a dialogue between two named speakers, where the first utters a declarative sentence with the target content and the second directly dissents with the target content. 
      %
      Finally, in Exp.~4 (`yes, but' diagnostic, \ref{diag.d}), participants read a dialogue between two named speakers where the first utters a declarative sentence that contributes the target content and the second responds with one of two indirect dissent variants (\emph{yes, but..}, \emph{yes, and...}) or a direct dissent.

      \ex.\label{diag} Implementation of the diagnostics in Exps.~1-4
      \a.\label{diag.a} Exp.~1 (QUD diagnostic)
      \\ {\bf Nora:} \emph{What did Lucy break?}
      \\ {\bf Leo:} \emph{Lucy, who broke the plate, apologized.}
      \b.\label{diag.b} Exp.~2 (`asking whether' diagnostic )
      \\ {\bf Nora:} \emph{Did Lucy, who broke the plate, apologize?}
      \c.\label{diag.c} Exp.~3 (direct-dissent diagnostic)
      \\ {\bf Nora:} \emph{Lucy, who broke the plate, apologized.}
      \\ {\bf Leo:} \emph{No, she didn't break the plate.}
      \d.\label{diag.d} Exp.~4 (`yes, but' diagnostic)
      \\ {\bf Nora:} \emph{Lucy, who broke the plate, apologized.}
      \\ {\bf Nina:} \emph{Yes, but she didn't break the plate.}
      \\ \hspace*{1cm} \emph{Yes, and she didn't break the plate.}
      \\ \hspace*{1cm} \emph{No, she didn't break the plate.}


      As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:trials}, the response options differed by diagnostic. In Exp.~1 (QUD diagnostic, panel (a)), participants rated how well the response fit the question on a slider marked `totally doesn't fit' on one end (coded 0) and `totally fits' on the other end (coded as 1). In Exp.~2 (`asking whether' diagnostic, panel (b)), participants judged whether the question was about the target content, using a slider marked `no' on one end (coded as 0) and `yes' on the other (coded as 1). In Exp.~3 (direct-dissent diagnostic, panel (c)), participants rated the naturalness or the direct dissent on a slider marked `totally unnatural' (coded as 0) on one end and `totally natural' on the other (coded as 1). Finally, in Exp.~4 (`yes, but' diagnostic, panel (d)), participants chose the response that sounded best; the two indirect dissents were coded as 0 and the direct one as 1. Across the four experiments, the responses were coded so that 1 meant that the content to be diagnosed was rated as at-issue and 0 as not-at-issue.

      Each of the seven contents in \ref{stims} was instantiated by one of the seven items shown in \ref{items} in each of the four experiments.
     
      \ex.\label{items}
        \a. Jack saw the murder.
        \b. Raul cheated on his wife.
        \c. Ann stole the money.
        \d. Danny ate the last cupcake.
        \b. Lucy broke the plate.
        \b. Dustin lost his key.
        \b. Greg bought a new car.
        \z.

      The four experiments also included two control stimuli, which functioned as attention checks: one stimulus was expected to receive a response at one end of the slider (Exps.~1-3) or a `no' response (Exp.~4); the other control stimulus was expected tor receive a response at the other end of the slider (Exps.~1-3) or a `yes' response (Exp.~4). See Supplement \ref{supp:stims} for the control stimuli used in Exps.~1-4.

      In all four experiments, each participant's set of items was generated by randomly combining each of the seven contents in \ref{stims} with a unique content in \ref{items}. Participants completed a total of 9 trials, namely 7 target trials and the same 2 control trials. Trial order was randomized.

      After completing the experiment, participants filled out a short optional demographic survey. To encourage truthful responses, participants were told that they would be paid no matter what answers they gave in the survey.

    \subsubsection{Data exclusion}

      We excluded the data of participants who did not self-identify as native speakers of
      American English and of participants whose responses to either one of the two control trials was more than 2 sd away from the group mean (Exps.~1-3) or whose responses to either one of the two control trials was wrong (Exp.~4).   Table \ref{t:excluded} shows how many participants were excluded in each experiment, the properties of the remaining participants, and the number of data points that entered into the analyses.

  \subsection{Results}
    Fig.~\ref{fig:results} plots the results of the four experiments by the expression that is associated with the seven target contents: panel (a) shows the mean naturalness ratings in Exp.~1 (QUD diagnostic), panel (b) mean `asking whether' ratings in Exp.~2 (`asking whether' diagnostic), panel (c) mean naturalness ratings in Exp.~3 (direct-dissent diagnostic) and panel (d) the proportion of `no' choices in Exp.~4 (`yes, but' diagnostic).

    \subsubsection{Range of by-content means.} We observe that the results of the four experiments differ in the range of the (mean or proportion of) ratings, that is, the difference between the largest and smallest ratings. The range is largest in Exp.~2 (`asking whether' diagnostic), at .74 (.1 to .83) and smallest in Exp.~3 (direct-dissent diagnostic), at .13 (.64 to .78). The results of Exp.~1 (QUD diagnostic, with a range of .27 (.51 to .77) and Exp.~4 (`yes, but' diagnostic), with a range of .46 (.5 to .96), fall in between. These results suggest that the four diagnostics, as implemented here, differ in how much they differentiate between the seven contents investigated, with the `asking whether' diagnostic showing the most differentiation and the direct-dissent and the QUD diagnostic showing the least.

    \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Rank order and Spearman rank correlations.} 
    We also find that the four experiments differ in the relative ratings assigned to the seven contents, with only limited overlap. Across all experiments, \emph{confirm} and \emph{discover} consistently received higher ratings (at least numerically) than \emph{confess}, which in turn received higher ratings than medial and final NRRCs. For all other pairs of expressions, however, the ordering was not consistent. In particular, the relative ranking of \emph{be right} and \emph{know} is inconsitent across experiments. For instance, the embedded content of \emph{know} was rated (numerically) lower than that of \emph{confirm} in Exps.~1 and 2, but higher in Exps.~3 and 4. The embedded content of \emph{be right} received the lowest ratings in Exp.~1, but was among the most at-issue in the other three experiments.

    %
    This difference between the results of the experiments is quantified in the Spearman rank correlations in {\bf JT: redo}  Table \ref{t:spearman}.\footnote{The Spearman rank correlation coefficient, a value between -1 and 1, is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation: the higher the absolute value of the coefficient, the more the relation between the the two variables can be described using a monotonic function. If the coefficient is positive, the value of one variable tends to increase with an increase in the other. In the case of our experiments, a coefficient of 1 for two experiments would mean that there is a perfectly monotone increasing relation between the mean ratings of the seven contents in the two experiments: for any two contents c1 and c2, if c1 ranks below c2 in one experiment (that is, the mean rating of c1 is lower than that of c2), then that ranking is preserved in the other experiment.}

    \begin{table}[ht!]
      \centering
      \begin{tabular}{l | c c c c}
      & Exp.~1 & Exp.~2 & Exp.~3 & Exp.~4 \\ \hline
      Exp.~1 (QUD diagnostic) & \cellcolor{lightgray} & .11 & -.29 & -.18 \\
      Exp.~2 (`asking whether' diagnostic) & \cellcolor{lightgray} & \cellcolor{lightgray} & .64 &.79 \\

      \hline
      % Exp.~4 (`yes, but' diagnostic) & & & & \cellcolor{lightgray} \\ \hline
      \end{tabular}
    \caption{Spearman rank correlations between the results of Exps.~1-4.}\label{t:spearman}
    \end{table}

    The rank correlations are particularly low for for Exp.~1 compared to the other three experiments, at least partly because of the low relative ranking of \emph{be right}. These results suggests that the four diagnostics as implemented in Exps.~1-4 interact differently with the seven contents investigated.

    \subsubsection{Pairwise differences between expressions.}  Finally, the experiments differ in whether they reproduce distinctions between contents reported in prior literature. Fig.~\ref{fig:pairwise} presents the results of posthoc pairwise comparisons of the estimated means/proportions for each content, using the `emmeans' package (\citealt{emmeans}) in R (\citealt{r}). The input to the pairwise comparisons were mixed-effects beta regression models (Exps.~1-3) or a mixed-effects logistic regression model (Exp.~4). All models were fit using the `brms' package (\citealt{buerkner2017}) using weakly informative priors. The models predicted the ratings\footnote{To model the ratings in Exps.~1-3 using a beta regression, the ratings were first transformed from the interval [0,1] to the interval (0,1) using the method proposed in \citealt{smithson-verkuilen2006}.} from a fixed effect of expression (with treatment coding and `be right' as reference level) and included random by-participant and by-item intercepts. The output of the pairwise comparison were 95\% highest density intervals (HDIs) of estimated marginal mean differences between each of the expressions. We assume that two contents differ if their HDI does not include 0.\footnote{The full model outputs are available in the folder {\bf where?} in the repository linked in footnote \ref{f:github}.}

    Recall that \citealt{syrett_experimental_2015}, using a variant of the direct-dissent diagnostic, found that sentence-medial NRRCs are more not-at-issue than sentence-final ones. In contrast, as shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:results} and \ref{fig:pairwise}, no such difference is observed in Exps.~1-3; and in Exp.~4 (`yes, but' diagnostic), we find the opposite: sentence-final NRRCs are rated less at-issue than sentence-medial ones. Thus, none of the diagnostics as implemented in Exps.~1-4 replicate \citeauthor{syrett_experimental_2015}’s finding.

    Recall also that
    % \citealt{tonhauser_how_2018} and
    \citealt{degen-tonhauser-glossa}, using the `asking whether' diagnostic, observed found a the following at-issueness differences among the content of the complement of clause-embedding predicates: \emph{know} < \emph{discover} < \emph{confess} < \emph{confirm} < \emph{be right} (where the embedded content of \emph{know} is least at-issue, and that of \emph{be right} is most at-issue). As shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:results} and \ref{fig:pairwise}, Exp.~2 (`asking whether') largely replicates this pattern, except that \emph{confess} and \emph{discover} do not differ.

    In Exp.~1 (QUD diagnostic), the embedded content of \emph{confirm} is more at-issue than that of \emph{confess, know,}, but the only other difference observed (among clause-embedding predicates) is that the embedded content of \emph{be right} is less at-issue than those of the other predicates --- the direction of this difference is the opposite from that observed in prior literature and the other experiments. In Exp.~3, no differences between the embedded contents of clause-embedding predicates are found. Finally, in Exp.~4, the content of the complement of \emph{be right} is more at-issue than those of \emph{confirm, confess,} and \emph{know}, that of \emph{confirm} is more at-issue than that of \emph{confess}, and that of \emph{discover} is more at-issue than that of \emph{confess}. These results suggest that the diagnostics, as implemented in Exps.~1-4, differ in whether they indicate differences in at-issueness between the contents of the complements of the five clause-embedding predicates included in the experiments.

      \label{fig:pairwise}
    \end{figure}

    These results also lend further support to the above reported finding that the four diagnostics, as implemented here, differ in how much they differentiate between the seven contents investigated. In particular, while none of the experiments found differences between medial and final NRRCs, the results of Exp.~2 (`asking whether' diagnostic) distinguished between most of the contents of the complements of the five clause-embedding predicates, whereas the results of Exp.~3 (direct-dissent diagnostic) distinguished between the least of these contents. In line with the range of means/proportions reported above, the pattern of differences between contents suggests that the `asking whether' diagnostic showed the most differentiation, while the direct-dissent and QUD diagnostics showed the least.

  \subsection{Discussion}

    Exps.~1-4 were designed to compared the results of four different diagnostics of at-issueness that have been used in prior literature. The results of the experiments suggest that the diagnostics, in the particular way in which they were implemented in the experiments, differ on several dimensions.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item They differ in the extent to which they differentiate between the seven contents investigated. with the `asking whether' diagnostic of Exp.~2 showing the most differentiation (as evidenced by the range of means and amound of pairwise differences) and the direct-dissent diagnostic of Exp.~3 showing the least.

      \item They differ in the relative order of the seven contents. In particular, the relative ranking of \emph{be right} and \emph{know} differs across Exps.~1--4.

    \end{enumerate}

    This section offers discussion of these findings, particularly addressing the question why the `asking whether' exhibits the most differentiation among the diagnostics, why \emph{be right} in particular ranks high under all diagnstics except for the QUD diagnostic, and how the differences between diagnostics we found bear on whether they target distinct underlying notions of at-issueness.

    \subsubsection{Why does the `asking whether' diagnostic show greater differentiation?}
      One of the most noticable differences between the results of the experiments is that Exp.~2 (`asking whether') produced a much larger range of ratings and finer-grained differentiation among contents than the other diagnostics. Why might this be?
      %
      Prior work has emphasized a divide between question-based diagnostics (QUD, `asking whether') and assertion-based diagnostics (direct-dissent, `yes, but'): Question-based tests are taken to probe whether a proposition is at issue relative to a QUD introduced in discourse, wheras assertion-based tests are taken to target a different underlying notion (\citealt{snider_anaphoric_2017,snider_at-issueness_2017,snider_distinguishing_2018,koev_notions_2018,faller_discourse_2019,korotkova_evidential_2020}). This distinction, however, could not explain why the `asking whether' diagnostic exhibits a particular behavior to the exclusion of the QUD diagnostic, since both are question-based.

      There are two crucial differences that set apart the `asking whether' test from the other three: First, it is the only diagnostic where the target content itself occurs inside a polar question, whereas the other diagnostics test content embedded in declarative assertions. Second, it is the only diagnostic in which participants are asked directly about the intentions of the speaker, whereas the other ones collect measures that are more indirectly tied to semantic interpretation, such as acceptability ratings and continuation choices. Either of these distinctive characteristics could account for the greater differentiation. This yields two hypotheses, which we tested in Exps.~5–6, presented in the next section.

    \subsubsection{The QUD diagnostic and \emph{be right}}
      One of the most striking differences between the results of the experiments concerns the content of the complement of \emph{be right} in Exp.~1 (QUD diagnostic) vs.\ the other three experiments. As shown in panel (a) of Fig.~\ref{fig:results}, participants gave relatively high naturalness ratings to responses like that in \ref{beright.a}, suggesting that they did not take the response to fit the question. As discussed above, the content of the complement of \emph{be right} emerged as the most not-at-issue in Exp.~1. 

      \ex.
      \a.\label{beright.a}  Exp.~1 (QUD diagnostic) with \emph{be right}
      \\ {\bf Nora:} \emph{What did Lucy break?}
      \\ {\bf Leo:} \emph{Danny is right that she broke the plate.}
      \b.\label{beright.b} Exp.~2 (`asking whether' diagnostic )
      \\ {\bf Nora:} \emph{Is Danny right that she broke the plate?}
      \c.\label{beright.c} Exp.~3 (`direct dissent' diagnostic)
      \\ {\bf Nora:} \emph{Danny is right that she broke the plate.}
      \\ {\bf Leo:} \emph{No, she didn't break the plate.}
      \d.\label{beright.d} Exp.~4 (`yes, but' diagnostic)
      \\ {\bf Nora:} \emph{Danny is right that she broke the plate.}
      \\ {\bf Leo:} \emph{Yes, but she didn't break the plate.}
      \\ \hspace*{1cm} \emph{Yes, and she didn't break the plate.}
      \\ \hspace*{1cm} \emph{No, she didn't break the plate.}

      Why might this be? We hypothesize that this is because \emph{be right} signals that the question of whether Lucy broke the place must be salient in discourse. But no such discourse context is given and it is difficult to accommodate, so low naturalness ratings. This doesn't happen in the other diagnostics, shown in \ref{beright.b} to \ref{beright.d}.\footnote{When \emph{be right} is excluded, the Spearman rank correlations are:

      \begin{tabular}{l | c c c c}
      & Exp.~1 & Exp.~2 & Exp.~3 & Exp.~4 \\ \hline
      Exp.~1 (QUD diagnostic) & \cellcolor{lightgray} & .77 & .09 & .31 \\
      Exp.~2 (`asking whether' diagnostic) & \cellcolor{lightgray} & \cellcolor{lightgray} & .66 & .66 \\
      Exp.~3 (`direct dissent' diagnostic) & \cellcolor{lightgray}& \cellcolor{lightgray} & \cellcolor{lightgray} & .77  \\
      \hline
      % Exp.~4 (`yes, but' diagnostic) & & & & \cellcolor{lightgray} \\ \hline
      \end{tabular}} So, when using a particular diagnostic, one also has to worry about whether the expression might presuppose a particular context, if one wants to ask about how well an utterance fits the context.

    % \subsubsection{Medial vs. final appositive NRRCs}
      %   As mentioned above, none of our experiments replicated the effect reported in \citealt{syrett_experimental_2015}, that sentence-final NRRCs are more at-issue than sentence-medial ones. This includes Exp.~3, which implemented a variant of the `direct dissent' diagnostic that was used in \citealt{syrett_experimental_2015}. A difference between our Exp.~3 and Exp.~2 in \citealt{syrett_experimental_2015}, aside from the stimuli, is that we asked for naturalness ratings and they implemented it as a forced choice: do you choose to dissent with the main clause content or the content of the NRRC. An interesting follow-up would be to see whether our stimuli with the forced choice can reproduce their result.

      %   \lh{even more: Exp. 4, our forced-choice assent/dissent-based task shows the opposite effect.}

    \subsubsection{Different underlying notions?}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Correlation between Exp. 1 and Exp. 2 is .77, suggesting that higher QUD-match ratings were strongly associated with higher asking-whether ratings.

        \item Correlation between Exp. 3 and Exp. 4 is .77, suggesting that higher accptability ratings in the direct-dissent task were strongly associated with higher proportions of `yes'-answers.

        \item However, the correlation between Exp. 1 and Exps. 3/4, respectively, is only weak to moderate, while the corratlation between Exp. 2 and Exps. 3/4, respectively, would be characterized as strong, but again, is lower than when comparing the question-based and assertion-based diagnostics to each other. Is there any way to quantify this, or do significance testing on that?

        \item The correlation between all diagnostics suggests that there is an underlying property that they all are sensitive to, but the fact that the correlation is higher between those diagnostics that share theoretical assumptions about at-issueness should tell us something too. (what exactly? this is hard to say on an appropriate level of abstraction; I think concluding that they are sensitive to different underlying phenomena would be too strong here)

      \end{itemize}

    
        
\section{Experiments 5-6 \label{sec:3_more-experiments}}
  %
    Exps.~5 and 6 investigate whether the greater differentiation observed in Exp.~2 (`asking whether') was due to (i) embedding target contents in polar interrogatives or (ii) the response task, testing two hypotheses:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Question-embedding hypothesis:} Differentiation between contents (in terms of range of means and significant differences) is greater when contents are embedded in a polar question than in a declarative assertion.

      \item \textbf{Response-task hypothesis:} Differentiation is greater when participants are asked directly what the utterance is about, compared to tasks such as acceptability judgments or forced-choice continuations.

    \end{enumerate}

    To test these hypotheses, we compare the `asking whether' diagnostic to one that also embeds the target expression in a polar question but uses a different response task.

    The design of Exp.~5 is like that of Exp.~2, except that it measured at-issueness for the contents of the complements of the 20 clause-embedding predicates from \citealt{tonhauser_how_2018} and \citealt{degen-tonhauser-glossa}, listed in \Next.

    \ex. \label{ex:predicates}
        20 clause-embedding predicates from \citealt{tonhauser_how_2018,degen-tonhauser-glossa}:\\ 
        \emph{be annoyed, know, pretend, inform, see, hear, discover, acknowledge, think, admit, announce, reveal, confess, demonstrate, suggest, prove, establish, say, confirm, be right}
        \z. 

    Exp.~6 tested the same contents but used a `direct response' diagnostic, where participants read a dialogue between two named speakers, where the first utters a polar question uttered by a named speaker, which contributed the target content. Like in the direct-assent/dissent diagnostic for at-issueness, the second speaker utters `yes' answer and affirms the target content.

    \ex. Implementation of the diagnostics in Exps.~  5--6
      \a.\label{exp5} Exp.~5 (`asking whether' diagnostic )
      \\ {\bf Nora:} \emph{Is xx right that Lucy broke the plate?}
      \\ Question to participants: Is Nora asking whether Lucy broke the plate?
      \b.\label{exp6} Exp.~6 (direct-response diagnostic)
      \\ {\bf Nora:} \emph{Is XX right that Lucy broke the plate?}
      \\ {\bf Leo:} \emph{Yes, she didn't break the plate.}
      \\ Question to participants: How natural is Leo's response to Nora's question?
      
    Both experiments also measured projection data for the embedded contents of the 20 clause-embedding predicates, which were reported in \citealt{hofmann-etal2024}. Here we focus on the at-issueness data, which have not yet been reported.

    If the greater differentiation between contents found in Exp.~2 (compared to Exps.~1, 3,  and 4) is due to presenting the target content in a polar question embedding, we expect that results from Exps.~5 and 6 both show a similar range of means and sensitivity to differences between content meants. In contrast, if results from Exp.~5 and Exp.~6 still suggest that the `asking whether' diagnostic shows greater differentiatiation between contents than the direct-response diagnostic in Exp.~6, this would be compatible with the response-task hypothesis.

  \subsection{Methods}
    
    \subsubsection{Participants}

      We recruited 300 participants on Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform for Exp.~5 and 250 participants on Prolific for Exp.~6.\footnote{Exp.~5 was run in August 2019 and Exp.~6 in August 2021.} Participants recruited on Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform had U.S.\ IP addresses and at least 99\% of previous HITs approved. Participants recruited on Prolific had registered on the platform as living in the USA, to be born in the USA and as having English as their first language. They had an approval rate of at least 99\%.  Table \ref{t:recruited2} shows the age and gender distributions of the recruited participants.

      \end{table}

    \subsubsection{Materials and procedure}

      Each of the 20 clause-embedding predicates in \ref{ex:predicates} was instantiated by one of 20 embedded-clause items (listed in Supplement \ref{supp:a-clauses}). The two experiments also included the same six control stimuli. The contents of these control stimuli (details in Supplement \ref{supp:control56}) were expected to be at-issue and not to project, and were used to assess participants' attention. In both experiments, each participant's set of items was generated by randomly combining each of the 20 clause-embedding predicates in \ref{ex:predicates} with a unique item. Participants saw a total of 26 stimuli: namely one target stimulus for each of the 20 clause-embedding predicates and the same 6 control trials.\footnote{Each participant saw their set of 26 stimuli twice, once in the projection block and once in the at-issueness block. Block order was randomized. As mentioned above, we focus here on the at-issueness ratings.} Trial order was randomized.
  	
      Participants were asked to imagine that they are at a party and that, when walking into the kitchen, they overhear somebody say something to somebody else.

      As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:trials56}, the response task differed between experiments. In Exp.~5 (`asking whether' diagnostic, panel (a)), participants judged whether the question was about the target content, using a slider marked `no' on one end (coded as 0) and `yes' on the other (coded as 1). In Exp.~6 (direct-response diagnostic, panel (b)), participants rated whether the response to the first speaker sounds good, on a slider marked `no' (coded as 0) on one end and `yes' on the other (coded as 1). Across both experiments, the responses were coded so that 1 meant that the content to be diagnosed was rated as at-issue and 0 as not-at-issue.

      After completing the experiment, participants filled out a short optional demographic survey. To encourage truthful responses, participants were told that they would be paid no matter what answers they gave in the survey.

    \subsubsection{Data exclusion}
    
      We excluded the data of participants who did not self-identify as native speakers of American
      English, of participants whose responses to the projection or at-issueness controls were more than 2 sd away from the group mean, and of participants who always selected roughly the same point on the response scale for the target stimuli. To identify such participants, we first identified participants whose mean variance on the target stimuli was more than 2 sd below the group mean variance and then manually inspecting their response patterns. Due to a programming error, 5 participants took Exp.~5 more than once. Since we were not able to identify which submission was their first submission, the data of these participants was also excluded. Table \ref{t:excluded2} shows how many participants were excluded in each experiment, the properties of the remaining participants, and the number of data points that entered into the analyses.

        \end{table}

  \subsection{Results}
    Fig.~\ref{fig:results2} plots the results of the two experiments by embedding predicate: panel (a) shows the mean `asking whether' ratings in Exp.~5 (`asking whether' diagnostic) and panel (b) shows the mean acceptability ratings in Exp.~6 (direct-response diagnostic).

    \subsubsection{Range of by-content means} 
    We observe that the results of the four experiments show a similar range of the mean ratings (again quantified as the difference between the largest and smallest by-content means). The range in Exp.~5 (`asking whether' diagnostic) is XX (.XX to .XX) and in Exp.~6 (direct-response diagnostic), it is XX (.XX to .XX). These results suggest that the two diagnostics implemented in Exps.~5 and 6 do not differ greatly in how much they differentiate between the 20 contents investigated.

Error bars indicate 95\% bootstrapped confidence intervals. Violin plots show the kernel probability density of individual participants' ratings.}
      \label{fig:results2}
    \end{figure}

    \subsubsection{Rank order and Spearman rank correlations} 
        
      We also find that the relative ratings assigned to the 20 contents shows high consitency: predicates whose embedded content is rated relatively not-at-issue in Exp.~5 are also rated relatively not-at-issue in Exp.~6, and vice-versa. This consistentcy between the results of the experiments is quantified in the Spearman rank correlation between the results of Exps.~5 and 6, which is $.93$, suggesting a particularly strong rank correlation for the by-content means. This result suggests that the two diagnostics as implemented in Exps.~5 and 6 interact similarly with the 20 target expressions investigated, when those are presented embedded in the same kind of utterance.

  \subsection{Discussion}

\section{General discussion \label{sec:4_discussion}}
  \subsection{Question (i): Do the various diagnostics yield the same results?}
    First, we aim to determine the extent of consistency or divergence across these diagnostics when applied to identical linguistic stimuli.

    \subsubsection{Differences}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item range + sensitvity: differences in how the diagnostics differentiate between contents; why is this? ceiling effects? compare to NAI control means // there is a question here of whether there would be a significant difference between the AI-control, and the other contents. someone who believes in binary at-issueness could say that all it needs for the test to work is that the tested contents lead to less acceptability compared to AI control.

        \item results from Exps.~1-4 suggesting that the four diagnostics implemented thereinteract differently with the seven contents investigated: no pairwise difference goes the same way in all experiments except for \emph{confess} $\leq$ \emph{discover}

        \item the diverging results suggest that the diagnostics cannot be applied  interchangeably, and theoretical claims made on their basis should be relativized to the diagnostic used (see also \citealt{snider_anaphoric_2017,snider_at-issueness_2017,snider_distinguishing_2018,koev_notions_2018,korotkova_evidential_2020})
      \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Correspondences/similarities}

      \begin{itemize}
        \item there is a correlation of the results of the `asking whether' diagnostic with those of direct dissent and `yes, but' diagnostics
        \item when excluding the \emph{be right} condition, there is a correlation of QUD one with the other ones, too (?) --- these are the correlations we should be looking at!
        \item now, we see some correlations between all tests, but stronger correlations between Exps 1+2, 3+4, respectively

      \end{itemize}

      

  \subsection{Question (ii): Do the existing definitions of at-issueness describe the same underlying phenomenon?}
    Second, by identifying areas of convergence and divergence, we aim to shed light on whether the differing diagnostics reflect distinct theoretical concepts of at-issueness or merely methodological variations in operationalizing a single underlying phenomenon.

    \subsubsection{Correspondence between the tests as evidence for sensitivity to a common underlying phenomenon}
      

      \begin{itemize}
        \item excluding \emph{be right}, we see some correlations between all tests

        \item why is that? -- there must be some common underlying property that they are both sensitive to, even if in different ways, of if there are other confounding factors

        \item for example, snider showed that the specificity of the direct dissent test goes away without polarity particles, suggesting that it is only about anaphoric availabiltiy rather than disagreement. he also argued that the at-issueness of propsitional content is neither necessary not sufficient for their availability as anaphoric antecedents for the propositional anaphor \emph{that}. however, even if anaphoric availability is not THE SAME as at-issuenes, then the correlation suggests that that the dissent-based tests (and therefore maybe anaphoric availability) are also modulated by at-issueness.

      \end{itemize}


    \subsubsection{Differential correspondence between the tests as potential evidence for different underlying phenomena}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item excluding \emph{be right}, we see some correlations between all tests, but stronger correlations between Exps 1+2, 3+4, respectively

        \item there is greater correlation between tests that share theoretical assumptions

        \item while the fact that there is correlation between all of them does suggest that they are sensitive to, or at least influenced by the same underlying phenomenon, there is a difference between the question-based tests and the assertion-based tests, in how much they correlate

      \end{itemize}



  \subsubsection{Medial and final appositives: no replication of S+K}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item we were not  able to reproduce \citepos{syrett_experimental_2015} finding that final appositive NRRCs are more at-issue than medial ones under any of the diagnostics. in fact, the assertion-based `yes but' test shows the opposite effect.
      \item no evidence that there is a notion of at-issueness under which final appositives are more at-issue than medial ones.
      \item some more comparison between direct dissent, some more detail maybe for the yes-but test may potentially allow us to say more here, but I don't think that this is urgent to do before the presentation
    \end{itemize}

  \subsection{Speech act and concepts of at-issueness}
    We found that it makes a difference what speech act the tested content is in. This can be related to theoretical notions of QUD-based at-issueness definitions, and questions about what happens in assertion-based diagnostics.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item the difference between exp 6 and 3 shows that the speech act that makes something at-issue, or contributed not-at-issue content makes a difference

      \item Is that because the at-issueness notion that is relevant for questions and assertions is fundamentally different (Koev), or because the diagnostics engage with an underlying notion of QUD-at-issueness, whereas the assertion-based tests introduce some confound(s), as Snider suggests?

      \item I think we cannot make an empirical argument without using additional data. but we can make a theoretical argument: 
      \begin{itemize}
        \item the literature that highlighted the proposal nature of assertions, also highlighted their similarities to questions, suggesting that asking whether $p$, and asserting $p$ both introduce a new issue (/QUD) about whether $p$, a propositional antecedents dref for $p$; and the similarities should explain why both can be responded to in the same way using polarity particles \citealt{farkas_reacting_2010}

        \item the real theoretical difference between assertive proposals and polar questions assumed there is that the polar question is an entailment-cancelling environment, and does not entail $p$ (/commit the speaker to $p$), whereas the assertion, of course, does

        \item since non-at-issue content projects, this phenomenon interacts with speaker commitment, there is a sense in which the not-at-issue content is pragmatically entailed (/presupposed) by the utterance

        \item therefore, it is not clear what it means to agree with an assertive utterance as a whole by saying \emph{yes/no} to that utterance, when we are agreeing/disagreeing with the non-at-issue content.

        \item when we say yes, we might want to say yes to the main assertion, and to some extent its other inferences, and the logical relationship between them plays a role as well

        \item recall the direct assent test with negated assertions (I should go back to my notes there, to make this point about the confound with assertion and commitment clearer again)

        \ex. \a. Cole didn't admit that Julian dances salsa.
          \b. Yes, that's true, Julian dances salsa.
          \z.
        \z. 

        \item it is important, what's the logical relationship between the main clause content, and embedded content (entailment, non-entailment, negation)

      \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item  whether the status of a content as (not-)at-issue is introduced as a QUD or as the proposal contributed by an assertion.
        \item the most sensitive test for at-issueness
        \item however, the QUD-test still tests the at-issueness of content in an assertive utterance relative to a preceding question. no previous literature has suggested that the speech act of the content being tested itself plays a large role.
        \item Polar questions highlight differences in at-issueness by showing how well a proposition can partition the context set: some contents do this clearly, others less so, and some only partially. By contrast, the other diagnostics depend on anaphoric accessibility (e.g., suitability for response particles) or on how well an assertion addresses a prior QUD, which may blur such distinctions.

        \item We hypothesize that the polar question embedding highlights at-issueness differences. Content is differently suitable to partition the context set, with some content really well able to do this and other content not, and other content inbetween. All the other diagnostics rely on anaphoric accessibility of the proposition or how well it can address a question in prior discourse.

        \item To our knowledge, no previous literature has proposed that the speech act of the tested content itself could be a major driver of differentiation.

      \end{itemize}

\section*{Data availability/Supplementary files (if applicable)}

  The journal encourages authors to make all data associated with their submission openly available, according to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable). More information can be found \href{https://www.glossa-journal.org/site/editorial-policies/#data-policy}{here}.

  If data/supplementary files are to be associated with the accepted paper, one of the options below should be followed:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item upload the files to your chosen open repository and make note of the DOI that they will provide (most suitable for datasets or information that act as foundations to the research being published. This option makes the files more findable and more citable). We recommend an open repository such as osf.io, which allows you to create a "project" under which you can upload relevant files (datasets, analysis scripts, experimental materials, etc.). The project will be associated with a unique DOI. You can then include in your manuscript a citation of the OSF entry and/or a link to the project page on OSF, to direct interested readers to the supplementary materials. During review, please be sure that the link to the repository is anonymized to maintain a fully double masked review process. Instructions for doing this on the OSF may be found \href{https://help.osf.io/hc/en-us/articles/360019930333-Create-a-View-only-Link-for-a-Project}{here}. If you'd like to learn more about best practices for ensuring reproducibility, see \href{https://psyarxiv.com/hf297/}{Laurinavichyute and Vasishth (2021)}. Please contact us if you would like more information or advice about hosting your data on an open repository.
  \item upload the files to the journal system during the submission process, as `data files'. The journal will then host them as part of the publication and provide them with a DOI (most suitable for non-data files or very short pieces of information, although option 1 is also suitable for these if the author prefers).
  \end{enumerate}

  \noindent In both cases, a `Data availability' or `Supplementary files' section must be added prior to the reference list that provides a title and very short summary of the files for each file. If option 1 was selected, you should also provide the DOI in this section. For example:

  \noindent Supplementary file 1: Appendix. Scientific data related to the experiments. DOI: \doi{10.5334/gjgl.310.s1}

  Ideally, supplementary files are also cited in the main text.

  Please note that neither of the above two options will result in the files being typeset, so please ensure that they are in publishable format when you upload the accepted paper.

\section{Control stimuli in Exps.~1--4}\label{supp:stims}

  The examples in \ref{control1}-\ref{control4} provide the two control stimuli used in each of Exps.~1-4. For the a.-examples, participants were expected to give a `totally fits' response (Exp.~1), a `yes' response (Exp.~2), a `totally natural' response (Exp.~3), and a `no' response (Exp.~4); for the b.-examples, the opposite response was expected. The numbers  after each example identify the mean ratings (Exps.~1-3) or the proportion of `no' responses (Exp.~4) after excluding participants who did not self-identify as native speakers of American English (but before excluding participants on the basis of these controls), showing that the control stimuli worked as intended.

  \ex.\label{control1} Control stimuli in Exp.~1 (QUD diagnostic)
  \a. Mary: Which course did Ava take?
  \\ John: She took the French course. (.97)
  \b. Jennifer: What does Betsy have?
  \\ Robert: She loves dancing salsa. (.07)

  \ex.\label{control2} Control stimuli in Exp.~2 (`asking whether' diagnostic)
  \a. Mary: Did Arthur take a French course?
  \\ Question to participants: Is Mary asking whether Arthur took a French course? (.96)
  \b. Robert: Does Betsy have a cat?
  \\ Question to participants: Is Robert asking whether Betsy loves apples? (.02)

  \ex.\label{control3} Control stimuli in Exp.~3 (`direct dissent' diagnostic)
  \a. Mary: Arthur took a French course.
  \\ Lily: No, he took a Spanish course. (.87)
  \b. Robert: Betsy has a cat.
  \\ Maximilian: No, she doesn't like apples. (.05)

  \ex.\label{control4} Control stimuli in Exp.~4 (`yes, but' diagnostic)
  \a. Mary: Arthur took a French course.
  \\ Lily: Yes, but Lisa loves cats. / Yes, and he didn't take a French course. / No, he didn't take a French course. (.95)
  \b. Robert: Betsy has a cat.
  \\ Maximilian: Yes, but she is good at math. / Yes, and she loves it so much. / No, she doesn't like apples. (0)

\section{20 clauses}\label{supp:a-clauses}
  The contents of the following 20 clauses, which realized the complements of the 20 clause-embedding predicates, were investigated in Exps.~5--6:

  \begin{multicols}{2}
  \begin{enumerate}%[leftmargin=3ex,itemsep=-2pt]
      \item Mary is pregnant.
      \item Josie went on vacation to France.
      \item Emma studied on Saturday morning.
      \item Olivia sleeps until noon.
      \item Sophia got a tattoo.
      \item Mia drank 2 cocktails last night.
      \item Isabella ate a steak on Sunday.
      \item  Emily bought a car yesterday.
      \item  Grace visited her sister.
      \item Zoe calculated the tip.

  %\columnbrea      
      \item  Danny ate the last cupcake.
      \item  Frank got a cat.
      \item  Jackson ran 10 miles.
      \item  Jayden rented a car.
      \item  Tony had a drink last night.
      \item  Josh learned to ride a bike yesterday.
      \item  Owen shoveled snow last winter.
      \item  Julian dances salsa.
      \item  Jon walks to work.
      \item  Charley speaks Spanish.
          
  \end{enumerate}
  \end{multicols}

\section{Control stimuli in Exps.~5--6}\label{supp:control56}
  The control stimuli in Exps.~5--6 were the contents of the main clause polar questions in \Next. The non-restrictive relative clauses (NRRCs), given in parentheses in \Next, were included in Exp.~6, where at-issueness was measured with an assent diagnostic. The control stimuli here consisted of two clauses (like the target stimuli), to allow the relevant speaker to assent with one of two clauses.

  \ex. Sentences for control stimuli in in question embedding experiments (Exps.~5--6)
    \a. Do these muffins (, which are really delicious,) have blueberries in them?
    \b. Does this pizza (, which I just made from scratch,) have mushrooms on it? 
    \b. Was Jack (, who is my long-time neighbor,) playing outside with the kids? 
    \b. Does Ann (, who is a local performer,) dance ballet?
    \b. Were John's kids (, who are very well-behaved,) in the garage?
    \b. Does Samantha (, who is really into fashion,) have a new hat?
    \z.
  \z.

  We expected participants to give low responses on the at-issueness diagnostics for the control stimuli in \Last, indicating that the main clause content is at-issue.
