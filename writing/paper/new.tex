\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
  at-issueness is a key concept in theoretical semantics/pragmatics, but there is no consensus about how it is defined or diagnosed (e.g., \citealt{tonhauser_diagnosing_2012,snider_anaphoric_2017,snider_distinguishing_2018,tonhauser_how_2018,koev_notions_2018,faller_discourse_2019,korotkova_evidential_2020}). We present experimental data investigating whether four widely used diagnostics for at-issueness yield consistent results. Our findings reveal significant differences across diagnostics, indicating they are not interchangeable. Since the diagnostics target distinct theoretical conceptions of at-issueness, these differences offer insight into their comparability.

\section{Control stimuli in Exps.~1-4}\label{supp:stims}

  The examples in \ref{control1}-\ref{control4} provide the two control stimuli used in each of Exps.~1-4. For the a.-examples, participants were expected to give a `totally fits' response (Exp.~1), a `yes' response (Exp.~2), a `totally natural' response (Exp.~3), and a `no' response (Exp.~4); for the b.-examples, the opposite response was expected. The numbers  after each example identify the mean ratings (Exps.~1-3) or the proportion of `no' responses (Exp.~4) after excluding participants who did not self-identify as native speakers of American English (but before excluding participants on the basis of these controls), showing that the control stimuli worked as intended.

  \ex.\label{control1} Control stimuli in Exp.~1 (QUD diagnostic)
  \a. Mary: Which course did Ava take?
  \\ John: She took the French course. (.97)
  \b. Jennifer: What does Betsy have?
  \\ Robert: She loves dancing salsa. (.07)

  \ex.\label{control2} Control stimuli in Exp.~2 (`asking whether' diagnostic)
  \a. Mary: Did Arthur take a French course?
  \\ Question to participants: Is Mary asking whether Arthur took a French course? (.96)
  \b. Robert: Does Betsy have a cat?
  \\ Question to participants: Is Robert asking whether Betsy loves apples? (.02)

  \ex.\label{control3} Control stimuli in Exp.~3 (direct-dissent diagnostic)
  \a. Mary: Arthur took a French course.
  \\ Lily: No, he took a Spanish course. (.87)
  \b. Robert: Betsy has a cat.
  \\ Maximilian: No, she doesn't like apples. (.05)

  \ex.\label{control4} Control stimuli in Exp.~4 (`yes, but' diagnostic)
  \a. Mary: Arthur took a French course.
  \\ Lily: Yes, but Lisa loves cats. / Yes, and he didn't take a French course. / No, he didn't take a French course. (.95)
  \b. Robert: Betsy has a cat.
  \\ Maximilian: Yes, but she is good at math. / Yes, and she loves it so much. / No, she doesn't like apples. (0)
