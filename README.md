## Folders in this directory:
### Conglei-thesis: experiments reported on in Conglei's thesis and analysis of the results (pilots and main experiments)
### experiments: experiments files from Conglei's thesis, in preparation for journal publication
### results: main directory copied from Conglei's thesis, in preparation for journal publication (what is in "1A"?)
### writing: preparing for journal publication

## To do
### current
- draft based on existing experiments
  - intro (LH)
  - methods, results descriptive summaries (JT)
  - stats
  - results analysis, discussion
  - limit: 13,000 wds total (including references) + supplements
- ~double check experiment code (JT)~
- make a table w all diagnostics that have been used for AI-ness; paper, exp, expressions tested, diagnostics -- into document

### future
- rerun direct dissent experiment to match S&K
- converge on main points
- prep workshop presentation (start Jul 1)
- finish article

## Findings + questions
- Asking whether test is most senstive to the distinctions. The other test are not really senstive enough to warrant the claims in the literature.. (why) did the tests work differently in the original studies?
- The order is different between tests (run stats); "be right" looks most interesting
