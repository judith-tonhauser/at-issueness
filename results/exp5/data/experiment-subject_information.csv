English,189,"This is very interesting to me and I feel unsure on some to them, like Q. Charles asks: ""Did Herbert suggest that Jayden rented a car?"". Is Charles asking whether Jayden rented a car? I feel yes he is asking but he is really asking if Herbert suggested this. Also for example, Christopher asks: ""Did Walt prove that Frank got a cat?"" Is Christopher asking whether Frank got a cat? He is asking if there is a cat but he is also asking if Walt proved it. I found this all very subjective and reread them so many times to try to perceive how they are interpreted. This was a lot of fun but also I was really worried about how accurate I am.
