"31516","<h3>Instructions</h3>  <p style='text-align:left'>In this experiment, you will read conversations between two people, as in this example, where Candy asks a question, and Lenny responds:</p>  <p style='text-align:left'> <b>Candy</b>: <i>What about the house? Is it big? </i> <br> <b>Lenny</b>: <i> Cassandra suggested that it's huge. </i> </p>  <p style='text-align:left'>We ask you to rate how natural Lenny's answer to Candy's question is. You will give your response on a slider from 'totally unnatural' to 'totally natural'.</p>  <p style='text-align:left'>At the end of the experiment, we will ask you some optional demographic questions (age, gender, native language). The experiment will take about two minutes.</p>  <p style='text-align:left' font size=""1"">By clicking on the button below you agree to participate in this experiment, which is conducted by researchers at the University of Stuttgart.
