## Folders in this directory:
### Conglei-thesis: experiments reported on in Conglei's thesis and analysis of the results (pilots and main experiments)
### preliminary-exps: experimentss that were run before Conglei's thesis
### results/main: directory with the analyses of the data. The data for Exps 1-4 come from Conglei's thesis (see folder Conglei-thesis); the data for Exps 5-6 come from the the repository https://github.com/judith-tonhauser/CommitmentBankPlus, where Exp 5 is 1_projaiQ and Exp 6 is 5_projaiQ
### writing: preparing for journal publication

## To do
### current
- draft based on existing experiments
  - intro (LH)
  - methods, results descriptive summaries (JT)
  - stats
  - results analysis, discussion
  - limit: 13,000 wds total (including references) + supplements
- ~double check experiment code (JT)~
- make a table w all diagnostics that have been used for AI-ness; paper, exp, expressions tested, diagnostics -- into document

### future
- rerun direct dissent experiment to match S&K
- converge on main points
- prep workshop presentation (start Jul 1)
- finish article

## Findings + questions
- Asking whether test is most senstive to the distinctions. The other test are not really senstive enough to warrant the claims in the literature.. (why) did the tests work differently in the original studies?
- The order is different between tests (run stats); "be right" looks most interesting
