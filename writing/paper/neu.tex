\begin{abstract}
  At-issueness is a key concept in theoretical semantics/pragmatics, but there is no consensus about how it is defined or diagnosed (e.g., \citealt{tonhauser_diagnosing_2012,tonhauser_how_2018,koev_notions_2018}). We present experimental data investigating whether four widely used diagnostics for at-issueness yield consistent results. Our findings reveal significant differences across diagnostics, indicating they are not interchangeable. Since the diagnostics target distinct theoretical conceptions of at-issueness, these differences offer insight into their comparability.

\section{Introduction \label{sec:1_introduction}}

  At-issueness is a key concept in theoretical semantics and pragmatics, distinguishing between at-issue propositions conveyed by an utterance, those contributing to its main point, and those that do not (e.g., \citealt{karttunen_conventional_1979,horton_presuppositions_1988,abbott_presuppositions_2000,faller_semantics_2003,potts_logic_2005,tonhauser_diagnosing_2012}). Despite its importance, the concept lacks a unified definition. Instead, various theoretical notions (\citealt{koev_notions_2018,tonhauser_how_2018}) and empirical diagnostics (e.g., \citealt{tonhauser_diagnosing_2012}) have been proposed. This paper addresses the question whether four widely used diagnostics for at-issueness yield consistent results when testing the same stimuli. Our findings reveal significant differences across diagnostics, indicating they are not interchangeable. Since the diagnostics target distinct theoretical conceptions of at-issueness, these differences offer insight into the comparability of these conceptions.

  The four diagnostics we tested are illustrated in (\pref{qud}--\pref{yesbut}) for sentence-medial non-restrictive relative clauses (NRRCs), which are usually taken to contribute non-at-issue content.  As appositive content is generally taken to be not-at-issue, participants are expected to: Give low naturalness ratings under the QUD diagnostic \ref{qud} and the direct dissent diagnostic \ref{dd}, not interpret the speaker to be asking about the content under the `asking-whether' diagnostic in \ref{aw}, will choose one of the \emph{yes}-responses under the `yes, but' diagnostic in \ref{yesbut}.
